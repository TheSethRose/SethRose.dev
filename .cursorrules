# NextJS React 19 Project Rules
description: Rules for a NextJS project with React 19, TypeScript, ShadCN, and Tailwind 4
auto_attach: true

# Global rules that apply to the entire project
global:
  - Follow functional component patterns with React hooks
  - Use TypeScript for type safety throughout the project
  - Implement ShadCN UI components with Tailwind 4 styling
  - Prefer async/await for asynchronous operations
  - Implement comprehensive error handling
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs where appropriate
  - Omit semicolons in JavaScript/TypeScript files
  - Use server components in NextJS where appropriate for better performance
  - Wrap client components in Suspense with fallbacks for loading states
  - Optimize images using WebP format and implement lazy loading
  - Minimize global styles; prefer modular, scoped styles with Tailwind
  - Follow clean code principles for readability and maintainability
  - Use environment variables for configuration following NextJS best practices
  - Never run npm commands that start the development server or build the project
  - Suggest writing or updating tests when adding features or fixing bugs
  - Update documentation to reflect code changes in the same pull request
  - Document new components, API endpoints, and features according to established templates
  - Only document features and components that actually exist in the project

# Assistant behavior and memory management
assistant:
  - Follow guidelines in .cursor/rules/assistant.yaml for behavior, tone, and task execution
  - Use .cursor/rules/memory.yaml for storing and retrieving project-specific information
  - Be interactive and helpful while maintaining conciseness and directness
  - Prioritize security and refuse to work with potentially malicious code
  - Verify all code changes with appropriate linting and typechecking

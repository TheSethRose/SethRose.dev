description: Rules for TypeScript files in the project
pattern: "**/*.ts"
exclude: "**/*.test.ts"

rules:
  - Use TypeScript's strict mode for maximum type safety
  - Define explicit return types for functions
  - Use interfaces for object shapes that will be implemented or extended
  - Use type aliases for union types, intersection types, and tuple types
  - Avoid using 'any' type; use 'unknown' when type is truly unknown
  - Use type guards to narrow types when necessary
  - Leverage TypeScript utility types (Partial, Required, Pick, etc.)
  - Use readonly modifier for immutable properties
  - Define enums for values that represent a specific set of options
  - Use generics to create reusable components and functions
  - Omit semicolons in accordance with project style
  - Use async/await for asynchronous operations
  - Implement proper error handling with try/catch blocks
  - Use descriptive variable names with appropriate auxiliary verbs

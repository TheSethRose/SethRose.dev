description: Rules for React components in the project
pattern: "**/*.tsx"
exclude: "**/*.test.tsx"

rules:
  - Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
  - Implement proper TypeScript typing for props and state
  - Use destructuring for props and state variables
  - Keep components focused on a single responsibility
  - Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
  - Use React.memo for performance optimization when appropriate
  - Implement error boundaries for critical components
  - Add JSDoc comments for complex components
  - Use the 'use client' directive only when necessary for client components
  - Wrap client components in Suspense with appropriate fallbacks
  - Prefer controlled components over uncontrolled components
  - Use ShadCN UI components when available instead of creating custom ones
  - Implement proper accessibility attributes (aria-* attributes)
  - Use semantic HTML elements whenever possible

description: Rules for documentation in the project
pattern: "docs/**/*.md"

rules:
  - Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
  - Use Markdown for all documentation files
  - Include code examples where appropriate
  - Document both the "how" and the "why" of implementation decisions
  - Use diagrams for complex concepts when needed
  - Follow a simple, flat documentation structure with a single file per major topic
  - Use consistent formatting and style throughout documentation
  - Include links to related documentation
  - Keep documentation concise and focused
  - Use headings and subheadings to organize content
  - Include a table of contents for longer documents
  - Use code blocks with syntax highlighting for code examples
  - Only document features and components that actually exist in the project
  - Focus on documenting the UI components, theme system, and page structure
  - Update documentation as part of the same pull request as code changes
  - Prioritize clarity and usability over exhaustive documentation
